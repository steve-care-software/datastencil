# Assignable
An assignable is a command that can be assigned to a variable because they return a value.


## Byte
The [byte](byte/readme.md) assignable executes the byte command.
```
byte.join [
    firstVariabke,
    "This is a string",
    342, // this is an unsigned integer
    -2, // this is an integer
    34.09, // this is a float
    [20, 34, 54, 67], // this is bytes
];
```
