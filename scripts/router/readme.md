# Router
The router takes the "route" keyword, then directory names that represents the path of the layer to execute, separated by dots.

# Example
This example would load the layer (path: ./os/files/x86/linux/save) and would pass this data to it: -[this is some data]
```
route os.files.x86.linux.save-[this is some data]
```
